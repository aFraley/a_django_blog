# A Django Blog
## Description
This is a "Blog" application that functions more as a message board. 
Skeleton is used as a CSS-Boilerplate instead of Bootstrap; 
Skeleton is "Light as a feather at ~400 lines & built with mobile in mind..." which I wanted to try out. 
It is simply an exercise in CRUD.
## Requirements
* [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/)
* [Django 1.10+](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [Skeleton 2.0.4+](http://getskeleton.com/)
